### Data Manipulation and Exploration using dplyr accompanied by visualizations using ggplot2.

&nbsp;

#### Assignment overview
I continue my treck and exploration of the gapminder dataset. In this assignment I will present how we can use R's awesome package dplyr to manipulate and explore a dataset (gapminder). I will further show how we can visualize dplyr's manipulated data using the ggplot2 package.  #The goal of this assignment is to manipulate and explore the gapminder further using the dplyr package, and applying visualizations of the manipulated data using the ggplot2.

In here I show the exploration, manipulation and analysis of some extracts from the gapminder dataset.
