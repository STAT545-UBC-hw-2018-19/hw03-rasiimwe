# STAT545A Homework 3 Repository of Rebecca Asiimwe 

## Data Manipulation and Exploration using dplyr accompanied by visualizations using ggplot2.

#### Assignment overview
I continue my treck :walking::walking: and explore the gapminder dataset. In this assignment I will present how we can use R's awesome package dplyr to manipulate and explore a dataset. I will still be using the gapminder dataset for this. I will further show how we can visualize dplyr's manipulated data using the ggplot2 package.  

For guests to my repo, please visit [howework1](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-rasiimwe) and [howework2](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw02-rasiimwe/blob/master/hw02.md) for a background on the gapminder dataset. In here I show the exploration, manipulation and analysis the gapminder dataset.
